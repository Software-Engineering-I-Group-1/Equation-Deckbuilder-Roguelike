# Equation Deckbuilder Roguelike (name in progress)
This project is Group 1's submission for Software Engineering I's final project.

## Description:
This project takes the form of an educational video game. It is meant for the 6th-grade to 8th-grade US schoolchildren demographic,
and will teach students how to form equations to meet different criteria. The goal of the project is to make a game that
will teach students to think critically about how they would go about forming certain numbers.

## Team roster:
Nicholas Johnson
Senny Lu
Angel Chikumbirike
Abhiram Garre
Orion Golden
Phyo Naing

Nicholas came up with the story and art. He and Phyo worked on the UI of the game.
We are all the software developers of this game.

## Prototype:
Our prototype has a main menu, a pause menu, and a settings menu. The settings menu is accessible from both the main menu and pause menu and has an option to adjust the volume.

## Demo Video:
YouTube had its first-ever video publication on April 23, 2005, and we have it as the placeholder for our demo video.
